## **Description**
Pretty straight forward version. It is a two player game, each takes turns trying to place an X or O such that they can get 3 in a row, colum, or across the diagonals. 

## **Goal**
The goal here was to achieve separation between the UI and the game logic. The UI handles this by using a "player" with an interface. The game logic works by implementing such an interface. 

## **Suggestions**
This code is intended as an exercise for me to apply my learning of Java. I am quite open to suggestions and recommendations for improvement.

## **License**
If you wish to use any of this code for personal and/or educational purposes you may freely do so as long as you do not claim it as your own. Give a guy a little credit if you use his work.

If you wish to make money with this code, such as publishing it in a tutorial or making a salable product I want a cut of the action. As unlikely as this may be, simply contact me, so we can work out the details.
